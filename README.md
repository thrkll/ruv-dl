## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repository to install `ruv-dl`:

`$ git clone https://github.com/thrkll/ruv-dl`

Install dependencies:

`$  pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Python 3.6+

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) in path

## üìñ Usage

### Basic download

Find the link to whatever it is you want to waste your time on and paste the URL after the input argument `-i`. 

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1`

### Resolution

By default, `ruv-dl` will download the mediafile at the best resolution offered by R√öV - 3600kbps at 1920x1080 (25fps). To download at a worse resolution, use the `-r` argument. 1 is best, 3 is worst.

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -r 2`

### Folder structure

If you are fancy üé© - make sure to include the `-f` argument. This will bundle the media file in a fancy folder together with all images and text description provided by R√öV.

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -f`

### Subtitles

Most video content on ruv.is comes with Icelandic :iceland: subtitles. `ruv-dl` will attempt to download these files and convert them to .srt files. To include them in the download, use the `-s` argument.

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -f -s`

### Filetypes

By default, all files will download as .mp4. But for the true snob, `ruv-dl` can use any file format supported by FFmpeg. Use the `-t` argument to specify the format.

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -t mkv`

### Different FFmpeg location 

In the optimal setup, FFMpeg will be available in the `$PATH`. Alternatively you can specify the location of the FFmpeg installation folder using the `-l` argument. 

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -l C:/ffmpeg/`

Note that depending on your FFmpeg build, you might need to link to `../ffmpeg/bin`.

### Help

When you eventually forget everything you've read here, you can use the `--help` argument.
