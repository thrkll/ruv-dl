## üìñ Usage 

#### Basic download

Find the link to whatever it is you want to waste your time on. Succeeding the input argument `-i` , paste in the URL. By default, the media file will download under the name R√öV defines it in best given quality. 

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1`

#### Resolution 
By default, `ruv-dl` will download the mediafile at the highest bitrate offered by R√öV (3600kbps). To download at a worse resolution, use the `-r` argument. 5 is best, 1 is worst. 

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -r 4`

#### Folder structure
If you are fancy üé© - make sure to include the `-f` argument. This will bundle the media file  in a fancy folder together with all images and text description provided by R√öV. 

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -f`

#### Subtitles
Most video content on ruv.is comes with Icelandic :iceland: subtitles. `ruv-dl` will attempt to download these files and convert them to .srt files. To include them in the download, use the `-s` parameter.

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -f -s`

#### Filetypes
By default, all files will download as .mp4. But for the true snob üßë‚Äçüé® `ruv-dl` can use any file format supported by FFmpeg. Use the `-t` argument to specify the format.

`$ python ruv-dl.py -i https://ruv.is/sjonvarp/spila/sample/30726/950qj1 -t mkv`

#### Help argument

When you eventually forget everything you've read here, you can use the `--help` argument.
